# mays-notation

This is demonstrating a way of notating numbers in a similar way to this:

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ciphers_of_the_Monks#:~:text=It%20describes%20the%20Cistercian%20numeral,9999%20as%20single%20compound%20characters.

However this system uses binary, with lines emanating from the center point acting as 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128. The outer lines that follow the edges of the box pick up as 256, 512, 1024, 2048, 4096, 8192, 16384, and 32768.

The benefits of this system? None really. I just thought that the Monk's Cipher could be a little more consistent and cover a larger range of numbers using binary.
